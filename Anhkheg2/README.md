# Anhkheg2
Application to track auto fuel purchases and mileage

This is a redesign of the original Anhkheg project, but using the built-in
persistence of the DateSet classes (XML files) instead of a SQL database. The 
main reason for the change is that Microsoft keeps changing its "light" version
of SQL Server and I don't want to go through the hassle of keeping it up-to-date.
